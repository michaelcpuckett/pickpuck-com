            If you build web pages, you're probably keenly aware that you're not just building for people who use the same technology you do. The code you write will be run on many different browsers on many different devices.
          </p>
          <p>
            The future of the web is looking increasingly inclusive and immersive. More people than ever are using voice and audio interfaces to interact with their phones and smart speakers. And emerging tech like augmented/virtual reality is positioned to bring the web to life. How do we account for all the ways people can interact with our code?
          </p>
          <p>
            It's possible by treating HTML not as a direct conversion from text to a graphical interface, but as a representation of objects and their state. Such a paradigm can be expressed in multiple dimensions.
          </p>
            <h3 id="heading-dimensions">6 Dimensions of HTML (and Counting)</h3>
            <ul aria-labelledby="heading-dimensions">
              <li><a href="#visual">Visual</a></li>
              <li><a href="#auditory">Auditory</a></li>

              <li><a href="#immersive">Immersive</a></li>
            </ul>

          <h2><a id="visual"></a>The Visual Dimension</h2>
          <p>
            Most web experiences are optimized for mouse users. But many people, for various reasons, use a keyboard, either exclusively or in tandem with a mouse or touch interface.
          </p>
          <p>
            Sighted users who primarily use a mouse to navigate the web may be unaware of the concept of focus. Only one element on a page can have focus at a time. This acts like a virtual cursor in a text document.
          </p>
          <p>
            The way to manipulate focus with the keyboard is by using the Tab key. To move to the next focusable element, Tab forward. To move to the previous focusable element, Shift + Tab backward. Then pressing the Enter key will trigger the element's action.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is important to keep the visual order of elements in the DOM in the same order as the source code, otherwise moving to the next tabstop could take you somewhere you might not expect. That means being careful with floats, and avoiding manipulating the order of items in flex and grid layouts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Other than the body, scrollable elements are not typically in the focus order, although they can be made to be by adding <span role="text" aria-label="Tab index equals Zero"><code aria-hidden="true">tabindex="0"</code></span>. Pressing Spacebar on any scrollable element that receives focus will scroll down by one screen. Shift + Spacebar scrolls up by one screen. Pressing the Up or Down Arrow keys scrolls incrementally. The Home key scrolls to the top, and the End key scrolls to the bottom. Don't recreate (or "hijack") the native scroll behavior on an element.
          </p>
          <p>
            When a user focuses a form element, such as a radio control, range slider, or select box, they may control the form element using the Arrow keys. Avoid attempting to recreate a form element with JavaScript and CSS, otherwise it will lose all its native accessibility features.
          </p>
          <p>
            You shouldn't need to code any JavaScript that listens for keyboard events if you are using the proper HTML elements. The click event handler will work across all input types. When inside a modal dialog, do listen for the Escape key, which should return focus to the main content. Otherwise, adding any special keyboard commands risks interfering with user preferences or other running software.
          </p>
          <p>
            Parallels to common mouse functionality, like drag-and-drop or resizing, can be achieved using the keyboard by adding actionable elements to the focus order. In some cases, a design change may be necessary to add the proper affordances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Also consider that markup in the visual dimension is powered by CSS. There are some system preferences for users with vision deficiencies and vestibular disorders that should be respected and accommodated. Animations and transitions should be turned off if the browser reports that the user "prefers reduced motion". Low-vision users may wish to override CSS with user styles that provide higher contrast or a bigger font size. Test the page with CSS disabled to ensure it's still usable.
          </p>

          <h2><a id="auditory"></a>The Auditory Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              For understanding how blind people use web pages, we need to look at screen readers. Screen readers are browser or system add-ons that use a synthesized voice to announce the label and properties of the currently focused element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Screen reader users typically input using the keyboard. You may remember that Tabbing only focuses actionable elements, so the containers for text content of a page normally cannot be selected by keyboard. But a screen reader opens up new ways of navigating the page and manipulating the virtual cursor. The user can navigate left and right with the Arrow keys to select every element, and the text inside will be read aloud. On mobile devices, the touch pad can be put in a mode that allows the user to swipe directionally to navigate and double tap to activate the currently focused element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keyboard shortcuts or touch gestures can call up an index of element types, giving a screen reader user the ability to scan for and jump to a specific link, a specific heading, or any other part of the page. Because of this, each accessible label should make sense out of context. When repeating the same elements in a list, there should be invisible accessible text that describes it. For example, a shopping list may have a list item with an element marked up as such:
              <figure aria-label="Code block for accessible text">
                <figcaption class="visually-hidden">A button that is labelled "Edit", which is available for all users, is accompanied by additional text for screen readers that says "Bananas"</figcaption>
                <div aria-hidden="true">
                  <div><code>&lt;button&gt;</code></div>
                  <div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;Edit</code></div>
                  <div><code>&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;span class="visually-hidden"&gt;(Bananas)&lt;/span&gt;</code></div>
                  <div><code>&lt;/button&gt;</code></div>
                </div>
              </figure>
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, a screen reader comes as part of your operating system, and you can turn it on in the accessibility section of the system's settings. If not, software can be downloaded for free. While debugging the screen reader experience, sighted developers can turn the sound off and see the announcements appear visually on screen.
            </p>

            <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
            <p>
              A web page must be marked up properly in order for a screen reader's virtual cursor scanning and navigation features to work properly. When a user focuses a button, the screen reader won't just read the text inside the button. It will also announce that it is a button element.
            </p>
            <p>
              The button may have additional state properties, such as being disabled, that also need to be announced to the user. This extra metadata sometimes comes for free by using the right HTML elements and attributes. For example, marking up all headings using heading elements (h1-h6) will make all them available when the screen reader scans for the list of headings. Properly marking up a table will provide additional keyboard controls for navigating the rows and columns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other times we need to go a step further. For those cases, we can turn to ARIA.
            </p>

            <h3>ARIA</h3>
            <p>
              ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. The "rich" part refers to the dynamic nature of JavaScript-heavy web pages. ARIA attributes can be added to and removed from HTML elements in order to indicate state changes. They are also used to indicate relationships between elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain combinations of elements and ARIA attributes are recommended for common scenarios, designed to work consistently across different screen reader software. For example, properly marking up a set of tabs will announce the component as a "tab control," which will be familiar to the user because it replicates the behavior of tabs across their operating system. These standardized experiences cannot be replicated without using ARIA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Running your markup through an HTML validator will ensure ARIA attributes are valid.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="tactile"></a>The Tactile Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              Screen readers can be connected to refreshable Braille displays. What would get read aloud by a screen reader can instead be read by touch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The amount of available space on the display can cause some announcements to be shortened, so screen readers usually have a visual Braille mode for debugging.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="vocal"></a>The Vocal Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              Users, for a number of reasons, may use their voice to navigate the web.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some users have robust voice recognition software for their operating system, and Android devices allow full control with Voice Access. Using only their voice, users can select and activate parts of a page, input text, toggle form controls, Tab through a page, and call up lists of specific element types. Sighted voice users may scan the page and then select an element using its visual label. Because of this, the underlying accessible labels for actionable items should include the text that appears visually on screen.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="programmatic"></a>The Programmatic Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              We should also consider the ability for external sites and services to gather information from the page for indexing and sharing.
            </p>
            <p>
              Devices like smart speakers that have an audio interface for reading web pages may parse the page's sectioning content to return the most relevant information.
            </p>
            <p>
              Search engine results may show specific data from a web page, such as the author of an article or the price of a product. That information must be properly marked up in order to appear, typically using itemprop attributes and vocabulary from schema.org.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are additional protocols for marking up how a page summary should appear when being shared on social networks, such as Facebook's Open Graph.
            </p>
              Users may have browser plugins that access the elements or metadata on a page for various reasons. Password managers, for example, need to be able to parse login screens.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="immersive">The Immersive Dimension</a></h2>
            <p>
              Finally, let's look to the future of immersive tech, which includes virtual reality and augmented reality (collectively "XR"). WebXR is a JavaScript API that is currently being developed to support XR devices. Consider the wide range of applications for fully or partially immersive experiences, especially for e-commerce, communication, and education.
            </p>
            <p>
              One challenge with WebXR is that it is rendered graphically with the notoriously inaccessible <span role="text" aria-label="canvas"><code aria-hidden="true">&lt;canvas&gt;</code></span> element. Developers will likely need to create an accessible version in the DOM in addition to the XR experience. It might seem that HTML has nothing to offer us here, but standards-based web components can fill the gap. Developers can create components that render both to the DOM and as WebXR, and then use those components to compose a combined interface that accomodates all users.
            </p>
