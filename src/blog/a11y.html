          <h2>What is 5D HTML?</h2>
          <p>
            Although we can do great things with JavaScript and CSS, the foundation of web accessibility is HTML.
          </p>
          <p>
            It's important to understand that HTML exists in five dimensions:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="#visual">Visual</a></li>
            <li><a href="#aural">Aural</a> (Auditory)</li>
            <li><a href="#tactile">Tactile</a></li>
            <li><a href="#vocal">Vocal</a></li>
            <li><a href="#programmatic">Programmatic</a></li>
          </ul>

          <h2><a id="visual"></a>The Visual Dimension</h2>
          <p>
            Most web experiences are optimized for mouse users. But many people, for various reasons, use a keyboard, either exclusively or in tandem with a mouse or touch interface.
          </p>

            <h3>Using the Keyboard</h3>
            <p>
              Sighted users who primarily use a mouse to navigate the web may be unaware of the concept of focus. Only one element on a page can have focus at one time. This acts like a virtual cursor in a text document.
            </p>
            <p>
              The way to manipulate focus with the keyboard is by using the Tab key. To move to the next focusable element, Tab forward. To move to the previous focusable element, Shift + Tab backward. Then pressing the Enter key will trigger the element's action.
            </p>
            <p>
              It is important to keep the visual order of elements in the DOM in the same order as the source code, otherwise moving to the next tabstop would take you somewhere you may not expect. That means being careful with floats, and avoiding manipulating the order of items in flex and grid layouts.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other than the body, scrollable elements are not typically in the focus order, although they can be made to be by adding <code>tabindex="0"</code>. Pressing Spacebar on any scrollable element that receives focus will scroll down by one screen. Shift + Spacebar scrolls up by one screen. Pressing the Up or Down Arrow keys scrolls incrementally. The Home key scrolls to the top, and the End key scrolls to the bottom. Don't recreate (or "hijack") the native scroll behavior on an element.
            </p>
            <p>
              When a user focuses a form element, such as a radio control, range slider, or select box, they may control the form element using the Arrow keys. Avoid attempting to recreate a form element with JavaScript and CSS, otherwise it will lose all its native accessibility features.
            </p>
            <p>
              You shouldn't need to code any JavaScript that listens for keyboard events if you are using the proper HTML elements. The click event handler will work across all input types. When inside a modal dialog, do listen for the Escape key, which should return focus to the main content. Otherwise, adding any special keyboard commands risks interfering with user preferences or other running software.
            </p>
            <p>
              Most common mouse interactions, like drag-and-drop or resizing, can be achieved by adding actionable elements to the focus order and providing a click event handler. In other cases, a design change may be necessary to add the proper affordances.
            </p>

            <h3>Accommodating People with Vision Impairments, Vestibular Disorders &amp; Cognitive Difficulties</h3>
            <p>
              Now let's take a moment to talk about accessible CSS.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are some user preferences for sighted users that should be respected and accommodated. Animations and transitions should be turned off if the browser reports that the user "prefers reduced motion" (possible due to a vestibular disorder). A user may wish to override CSS with user styles or turn off CSS completely and the page should still be usable.
            </p>
            <p>
              There should be a high contrast between the background and text color. Nothing should be distinguished using color only, because some people cannot perceive differences between certain colors.
            </p>
            <p>
              To avoid confusion, especially for people with cognitive difficulties, provide distinct, logical and consistent design variations for focus states, hover states, active states, pressed states, disabled states, etc. If having a visible focus state is distracting for you or some of your users, adding an input checking library will give you the ability to turn off focus only for mouse users.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="aural"></a>The Aural Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              For understanding how non-sighted people use web pages, let's remember the concept of the virtual cursor, which can be controlled using the Tab key. If you are sighted, imagine closing your eyes and selecting the next focusable element. You wouldn't know what it is, unless the computer told you in some other way. That's where screen readers come in.
            </p>

            <h3>Screen Readers</h3>
            <p>
              Screen readers use a synthesized voice to announce the label and properties of the currently focused element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Screen reader users typically input using the keyboard. You may remember that Tabbing only focuses actionable elements, so the containers for text content of a page normally cannot be selected by keyboard. But a screen reader opens up new ways of navigating the page and manipulating the virtual cursor. Now, the user can navigate left and right with the Arrow keys to select every element, and the text inside will be read aloud. On mobile devices, the touch pad can be put in a mode that allows the user to swipe directionally to navigate and double tap to activate the currently focused element.
            </p>
            <p>
              Keyboard shortcuts or touch gestures can call up an index of element types, giving a screen reader user the ability to scan for and jump to a specific link, a specific heading, or any other part of the page.
            </p>
            <p>
              Usually, a screen reader comes as part of your operating system, and you can turn it on in the accessibility section of the system's settings. If not, software can be downloaded for free. While debugging the screen reader experience, sighted developers can turn the sound off and see the announcements appear visually on screen.
            </p>

            <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
            <p>
              A web page must be marked up properly in order for a screen reader's virtual cursor scanning and navigation features work properly. When a user focuses a button, the screen reader won't just read the text inside the button. It will also announce that it is a button element.
            </p>
            <p>
              The button may have additional state properties, such as being disabled, that also need to be announced to the user. This extra metadata sometimes comes for free by using the right HTML elements and attributes. For example, marking up all headings using heading elements (h1-h6) will make all them available when the screen reader scans for the list of headings. Properly marking up a table will provide additional keyboard controls for navigating the rows and columns.
            </p>
            <p>
              Other times we need to go a step further. For those cases, we can turn to ARIA.
            </p>

            <h3>ARIA</h3>
            <p>
              ARIA stands for Accessible Rich Internet Applications. The "rich" part refers to the dynamic nature of JavaScript-heavy web pages. ARIA attributes can be added to and removed from HTML elements in order to indicate state changes. They are also used to indicate relationships between elements.
            </p>
            <p>
              Certain combinations of elements and ARIA attributes are recommended for common scenarios, designed to work consistently across different screen reader software. For example, properly marking up a set of tabs will announce the component as a "tab control," which will be familiar to the user because it replicates the behavior of tabs across their operating system. These standardized experiences cannot be replicated without using ARIA.
            </p>
            <p>
              Running your markup through an HTML validator will ensure ARIA attributes are valid.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="tactile"></a>The Tactile Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              Screen readers can be connected to refreshable Braille displays. What would get read aloud by a screen reader can instead be read by touch.
            </p>
            <p>
              The amount of available space on the display can cause some announcements to be shortened, so screen readers usually have a visual Braille mode for debugging.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="vocal"></a>The Vocal Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              Users, due to mobility limitations or other reasons, may use their voice to navigate the web. They can select and activate parts of a page, input text, toggle form controls, tab through a page, and call up lists of specific element types.
            </p>
            <p>
              Voice users may scan the page visually and then use voice recognition software to select an element using its visual label. Because of this, the underlying accessible labels for actionable items should match the text that appears visually on screen.
            </p>

          <h2><a id="programmatic"></a>The Programmatic Dimension</h2>
            <p>
              Lastly, we should consider the ability for external sites and services to gather information from the page for indexing and sharing. How is this an accessibility concern? Users on these external sites should be able to find, bookmark and share your page easily.
            </p>
            <p>
              The most obvious external service is search engine crawlers. Search engine results may show specific data from a web page, such as the author of an article or the price of a product. That information must be properly marked up in order to appear, typically using itemprop attributes and vocabulary from schema.org.
            </p>
            <p>
              There are additional protocols for marking up how a page summary should appear when being shared on social networks, such as Facebook's Open Graph. Users may also have browser plugins that parse this kind of metadata for various reasons.
            </p>
