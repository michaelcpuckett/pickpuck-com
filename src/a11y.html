        <h1>Accessible Web Pages with 4D HTML</h1>
      </header>

      <h2>What is 4D HTML?</h2>
      <p>
        Why isn't web development as easy as drag and drop? <em>It's because the underlying structure matters more than the visual representation alone.</em> We need to think about web pages less like blank canvases and more like text documents. We need to put more emphasis on supporting a diverse range of users, their preferences, and the various means by which they can complete a user journey.
      </p>
      <p>
        HTML, once sent down to a client, can exist in four dimensions. One dimension is visual, which is most familiar for sighted users, with three different input modes. Another is auditory, which includes voice control and synthesized speech. There is a tactile dimension for non-sighted and non-hearing users. Finally, there is a fourth dimension for search engines to crawl the web page and for other programmatic analysis. The 4D HTML thought process is about understanding and accomodating each one.
      </p>
        <h3>Does Accessibility Matter?</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Everyone has an accessibility limitation sometimes.</em> Consider the range of users who could be trying to access your website: from someone who is deafblind, to someone who is paralyzed and cannot move most of their body, to someone who has an injured arm that will eventually heal, to an able bodied person who has their hands full temporarily. The 4D HTML thought process is a starting point for addressing this wide range of user needs.
        </p>
        <p>
          Additionally, some organizations must comply with accessibility standards by law.
        </p>

      <h2>The Visual Dimension</h2>
      <p>
        Sighted users may prefer to read information on a page visually. A Responsive Design is usually necessary to account for the size and form factor of every device, from a narrow smartphone with an inset panel obscuring part of the screen to a 4K widescreen desktop. The markup should be the same and CSS should be responsible for rendering the layout at various screen sizes. The page should respond even if the users rotates the device or changes the size of the browser window.
      </p>
      <p>
        When considering the visual dimension, there are three primary input methods: mouse, keyboard, and touch. Be aware that many devices can accept any of these three input types at one time. Some devices can switch between primary input modes. There are some additional forms of input we should consider for people with mobility issues, such as head movement and joysticks, which are converted into mouse/keyboard/touch commands.
      </p>

        <h3>Focus, Form Controls &amp; Scrollable Elements</h3>
        <p>
          Sighted users who primarily use a mouse to navigate the web may be unaware of the concept of focus. Only one element on a page can have focus at one time. This acts like a virtual cursor in a text document. Switching focus with a mouse requires pointing and clicking on an actionable element, so this is not usually an important concept for mouse-only users. 
        </p>
        <p>
          However, <em>focus is the most important part of navigating a page for keyboard users.</em> If you had to give up your mouse, do you think you could still use a web browser? You should give it a try! The way to manipulate focus is by using the Tab key. To move to the next focusable element, tab forward. To move to the previous focusable element, shift + tab backward. Then pressing the Enter key will trigger the element's action. It is important to keep the visual order of elements in the DOM in the same order as the source code, otherwise moving to the next tabstop would take you somewhere you may not expect. That means being careful with floats, and avoiding manipulating the order of items in flex and grid layouts.
        </p>
        <p>
          Pressing Spacebar on any non-actionable scrollable element that receives focus (including the body) will scroll down by one screen. Pressing the Up or Down Arrow keys scrolls incrementally. The Home key scrolls to the top, and the End key scrolls to the bottom. Avoid trying to recreate (or "hijack") scrolling on an element, or else it will lose those native behaviors.
        </p>
        <p>
          When a user tabs to a form element, such as a radio control, range slider, or select box, they may control the form element using the Arrow keys. <em>Avoid trying to recreate a form element with JavaScript and CSS, otherwise it will lose all its native accessibility features.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some keyboard shortcuts that are part of every application, like for selecting all text, or copying and pasting. These are built into the browser and do not need to be added. Assistive browser add-ons like screen readers may include their own set of keyboard shortcuts. Because of this, it's best not to add any JavaScript that would override any of those default keyboard shortcuts. However, there are some instances, like when showing a modal dialog, where a keyboard user would expect to be able to use the escape key to return to the main content.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some complex scenarios, like drag-and-drop or resizing a panel, can be achieved by providing actionable elements that can be focused using the keyboard. However, you may want to consider redesigning components that rely too heavily on mouse-only interactions.
        </p>
        <p>
          For devices where the primary pointing device is a finger touch, there is no mouse cursor, so there is little or no concept of hover. No critical information should be shown only via hover. The tap target on actionable items should be tall and wide enough for everyone to find and press easily.
        </p>

        <h3>Accommodating People with Vision Impairments, Vestibular Disorders &amp; Cognitive Difficulties</h3>
        <p>
          Users with limited vision often increase the zoom level of the page (with command and +/- keys). Never disable zooming, and make sure complex interactions don't depend on specific heights, widths, or font sizes.
        </p>
        <p>
          There should be a high contrast between the background and text color. Nothing should be differentiated using colors only, because some people are colorblind. Some people have a specific colorblindness, like not being able to differentiate between green and red, and others see no color at all.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are some user preferences for sighted users that should be respected and accommodated. Animations and transitions should be turned off if the browser reports that the user <em>"prefers reduced motion"</em> (possibly due to a vestibular disorder). A user may wish to override CSS with user styles or turn off CSS completely and the page should still be usable.
        </p>
        <p>
          To avoid confusion, especially for people with cognitive difficulties, distinct, logical and consistent design variations should exist for focus states, hover states, active states, pressed states, disabled states, etc. If having a visible focus state is distracting for mouse users, it can be removed when using a mouse and visible when using a keyboard. This differentiation can be achieved with a library called what-input.
        </p>

      <h2>The Auditory Dimension</h2>
        <p>
          For understanding how non-sighted people use web pages, let's remember the concept of the virtual cursor, which can be controlled using the Tab key. If you are sighted, imagine closing your eyes and selecting the next focusable element. You wouldn't know what it is, unless the computer told you in some other way. That's where screen readers come in.
        </p>

        <h3>Screen Readers</h3>
        <p>
          <em>Screen readers use a synthesized voice to announce the label and properties of the currently focused element.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
          You may remember that tabbing only focuses actionable elements, so the containers for text content of a page cannot normally be selected by keyboard. But a screen reader opens up new ways of navigating the page and manipulating the virtual cursor. Screen reader users can navigate left and right to select every element, and the text inside will be read aloud. Screen reader users typically skim the page, either by speeding up the audio so they get the information faster, or by accessing a list of the page's elements. A list of elements gives a screen reader user the ability to scan for and jump to a specific link, a specific heading, or any other part of the page, without having to tab through or use the Left/Right Arrow keys.
        </p>
        <p>
          Usually, a screen reader comes as part of your operating system, and you can turn it on in the accessibility section of system settings. If not, software can be downloaded for free. While debugging the screen reader experience, sighted developers can turn the sound off and see the announcements appear visually on screen.
        </p>
        <p>
          Browsers expose data to screen readers via the Accessibility Tree and communicate via the Accessibility API (instead of the DOM). These can be debugged in the web inspector or at the operating system level.
        </p>

        <h3>Semantic Markup</h3>
        <p>
          Web accessibility is largely about marking up the page so that a screen reader's virtual cursor scanning and navigation features work properly. When a user focuses a button, the screen reader won't just read the text inside the button. It will also announce that it is a button. The button may have additional state properties, such as being disabled, that also need to be announced to the user. <em>This extra metadata sometimes comes "for free" by using the right HTML elements and attributes.</em> For example, marking up all headings using heading elements (h1-h6) will make all them available when the screen reader scans for the list of headings. Properly marking up a table will provide additional keyboard controls for navigating the rows and columns. Other times we need to go a step further. For those cases, we can turn to ARIA.
        </p>

        <h3>ARIA</h3>
        <p>
          ARIA stands for <em>Accessible Rich Internet Applications</em>. The "rich" part refers to the dynamic nature of JavaScript-heavy web pages. ARIA attributes can be added to and removed from HTML elements in order to indicate state changes. It is also used to indicate relationships between elements. Certain combinations of elements and ARIA attributes are recommended for common scenarios, designed to work consistently across different screen reader software. For example, properly marking up a set of tabs will announce the component as a "tab control," which will be familiar to the user because it replicates the behavior of tabs across their operating system.
        </p>

        <h3>Voice Control</h3>
        <p>
          Users, due to mobility limitations or other reasons, may use their voice to select, read, and activate parts of a web page. These users may scan the page visually and then use voice recognition software to select an element using its label. Because of this, it is important that the underlying accessible label for actionable items match the text that appears visually on screen.
        </p>

      <h2>The Tactile Dimension</h2>
        <p>
          Screen readers can be connected to <em>refreshable Braille displays.</em> Anything that can be read aloud by a screen reader can instead be read by touch. The amount of available space on the display can cause some announcements to be shortened.
        </p>
        <p>
          Users who have varying degrees of sight and hearing limitations may use a combination of assistive technologies at one time, including reading a line of Braille while listening to the same announcement as speech, occassionally referring to a zoom-in screened.
        </p>

      <h2>The Programmatic Dimension</h2>
        <p>
          Lastly, we should consider the ability for external sites and services to gather information from the page for indexing and sharing. How is this an accessibility concern? Users on these external sites should be able to find, access and share your page easily.
        </p>
        <p>
          The most obvious external service is search engine crawlers. Most search engines will attempt to run JavaScript and evaluate the DOM, but it is safest to deliver the HTML directly from the server. Google analyzes pages to see if they load fast enough and if they are mobile optimized.
        </p>
        <p>
          Search engine results may show specific data from a web page, such as the author of an article or the price of a product. That information must be properly marked up in order to appear, typically using itemprop attributes and vocabulary from schema.org.
        </p>
        <p>
          There are additional protocols for marking up how a page summary should appear when being shared on social networks, such as Facebook's Open Graph. Users may also have browser plugins that parse this kind of metadata for various reasons.
        </p>
